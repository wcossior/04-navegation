# Navegation
The Navegation project is a React Native application written in TypeScript (`.tsx`). Its primary purpose is to showcase screen navigation within the app. The application consists of 5 screens, each featuring minimal contentâ€”specifically, navigation buttons allowing users to move between screens and explore the navigation structure.

## Features
- **Screen Navigation**: The application demonstrates basic screen navigation across the 5 screens.
- **Navigation Buttons**: Each screen includes buttons enabling users to navigate forward or backward in the navigation structure.
- **Simple Interface**: Screens deliberately lack significant content, focusing on navigation and basic user interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **React Native**: The foundational framework for mobile app development.
- **TypeScript (`.tsx`)**: Provides static typing to enhance code quality and development experience.
